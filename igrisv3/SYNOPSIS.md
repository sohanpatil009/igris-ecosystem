# PROJECT SYNOPSIS

## IGRIS - Advanced Offline AI Voice Assistant

---

## ABSTRACT

IGRIS (Intelligent General-purpose Responsive Interactive System) is a fully offline, voice-activated AI assistant built using Rust and Dioxus 0.7 framework, designed to provide comprehensive hands-free control over desktop systems while ensuring complete data privacy. Unlike cloud-dependent voice assistants such as Siri, Alexa, or Google Assistant, IGRIS processes all voice commands locally using state-of-the-art machine learning models including OpenAI Whisper for speech recognition, SBERT for natural language understanding, and Piper for text-to-speech synthesis.

The system features a sophisticated voice processing pipeline that begins with wake word detection ("Arise"), followed by real-time speech-to-text conversion, semantic intent classification, and natural language response generation. IGRIS provides extensive functionality through a plugin-based architecture, enabling users to control applications, manage system settings (volume, brightness, connectivity), perform file operations, capture photos and videos, and set alarms and reminders through voice commands.

A key innovation of IGRIS is its unique self-presentation mode where the assistant explains its own architecture through animated slides with TTS narration, demonstrating its capabilities in an interactive manner. The system also features comprehensive camera control using FFmpeg integration for photo capture and video recording with real-time preview.

Built with performance and privacy as core principles, IGRIS operates efficiently on modest hardware (4GB RAM minimum) while maintaining real-time response latency under 500ms. The modular architecture ensures extensibility through Rust-based plugins, allowing users to adapt the assistant to specific workflows. The project demonstrates the feasibility of creating a powerful, privacy-focused voice assistant that operates entirely offline while maintaining high accuracy, low latency, and cross-platform compatibility across Windows, macOS, and Linux systems.
